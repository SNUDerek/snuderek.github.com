## ml projects

**[MLPy](https://github.com/SNUDerek/MLPy)**  
[ongoing] education-focused implementation of machine learning algorithms in `python+numpy` with detailed comments

**[Magic The Gathering Card Generation with LSTM Language Modeling](https://github.com/SNUDerek/mtgcardgenerator)**  
[ongoing] a fun side-project for generating MtG cards using neural networks using an LSTM-LM with weight tying.  
see some cards at [my MtG Cardsmith page](https://mtgcardsmith.com/user/dsh9470/cards)

**[Sequence-to-Sequence with Luong Dot Attention in `Keras`](https://github.com/SNUDerek/kerasdemo-seq2seq-attention/blob/master/seq2seq-roman.ipynb)**  
an annotated tutorial `keras` implementation of word-level recurrent sequence-to-sequence translation with attention.

**[Multipurpose LSTM_CRF Network with Attention for NER & Intent Detection](https://github.com/SNUDerek/multiLSTM)**  
a `keras` CNN-RNN-CRF with attention for joint named entity recognition (NER) and intent detection (Joint SLU task) with 'aligned seq2seq'. see notebook comments for description.

## remote computing setup guide

see my reference guide [here](sshguide.md)

- setting up remote access to a private server
- using `ssh` `sftp` and `scp`
- assigning a server a URL with Google Domains
- using `ngrok` to access `jupyter lab`
- setting up `PyCharm Pro` for remote execution
- etc
