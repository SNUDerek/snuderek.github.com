## technical skills

- programming: `python`
- data science & ML : `pandas`, `sklearn`, `R`
- deep learning : `keras`, `tensorflow`
- [github](https://github.com/SNUDerek)
- Linux
- MS Office (MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel)

## professional projects

**retrieval-based dialog assistant and conversation classifier**
tools: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `word2vec`, `sent2vec`, `keras`
- worked with technical advisors, engineering team to guide project development after departure of ML team lead
- mentored company interns and advised them with project sub-tasks
- data analysis of 1M+ historical chats with unsupervised clustering methods
- ML models for classifying at sentence and dialog level (dialog level: 83 F1)
- response recommendation using cosine similarity and statistical speech-act transition modeling
- helped port models & system from Korean to English for second client in new domain

**named entity recognition/joint SLU system**
tools: `keras`
- researched and implemented a flexible neural NER/joint-SLU tool for English and Korean
- led a team of two data analyst interns and two junior ML software engineers to complete project
- worked on data processing, data bootstrapping; researched input methods (tokenization, subword labeling), joint models
- korean grocery shopping domain entity (product, brand, size/type, count) detection (recall: 99.4)
- english travel domain using ATIS corpus (intent accuracy: 96.3, slot F1: 93.71) 

**limited-domain neural machine translation**
tools: `keras`, `pytorch`
- supervised one junior ML software engineer (duties: preliminary research, webcrawling, deployment)
- worked on data bootstrapping (webcrawling) and processing; data input methods including `wordpiece`
- researched `seq2seq` translation methods, transfer learning for low-resource translations
- implemented custom `keras` network for product title and composition translations
- developed `open-NMT-py` fork for product description translations (BLEU: 28.64, cf. Google NMT: 2.05)

## personal portfolio

[ongoing] a fun side-project for generating MtG cards using neural networks.  
see some cards at [my MtG Cardsmith page](https://mtgcardsmith.com/user/dsh9470/cards)

**[Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CRF in `Keras`](https://github.com/SNUDerek/NER_bLSTM-CRF)**  
a `keras` implementation of word-level bi-LSTM-CRF network for entity extraction

**[Multipurpose LSTM_CRF Network with Attention for NER & Intent Detection](https://github.com/SNUDerek/multiLSTM)**  
an extension of the above project for a unified NER and intent detection network
